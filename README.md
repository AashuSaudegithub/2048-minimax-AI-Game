🧠 2048 Minimax AI Game

AI-Based Academic Project

📌 Project Overview

The 2048 Minimax AI Game is an intelligent implementation of the classic 2048 puzzle, developed to demonstrate the practical application of Artificial Intelligence algorithms in game-based problem solving. The project uses the Minimax algorithm with heuristic evaluation to enable an AI agent to play the game autonomously and make optimal decisions under uncertainty.

This project was developed as part of an academic coursework / internship program to apply theoretical AI concepts in a real-world scenario.

🎯 Objective-

The primary objective of this project is to design an AI agent capable of achieving high scores in the 2048 game by:

Simulating future game states

Evaluating board positions using heuristic functions

Selecting moves that maximize long-term reward while minimizing failure

🧠 Algorithm & Approach-

The game is modeled as a stochastic decision-making problem. The AI alternates between:

Max nodes (player moves selected by AI)

Chance nodes (random tile generation of 2 or 4)

A depth-limited Minimax algorithm is used to balance performance and accuracy. Game states are evaluated using multiple heuristics, including:

Number of empty cells

Tile monotonicity

Tile smoothness

Maximum tile value

The move with the highest utility score is selected at each step.

🚀 Key Features-

Autonomous AI gameplay using Minimax

Heuristic-based board evaluation

Game tree simulation and optimization

Consistent achievement of high tile values

Demonstrates core AI and game theory concepts

🛠️ Technologies Used-

Language: Python

Concepts: Minimax Algorithm, Heuristic Evaluation, Game Tree Search, Artificial Intelligence
